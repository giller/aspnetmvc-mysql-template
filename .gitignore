This project is a template for building ASP.NET MVC applications using MySql, Code First Entity Framework and Mono.

While working with Mono I noticed that the default ASP.NET MVC application template generated by MonoDevelop 5.0.1 was broken by default. 

This Template fixes that problem and also includes the default configuration and packages for using code first EF with MySql.

This was made using for Mono and MonoDevelop but should still work with Windows.
